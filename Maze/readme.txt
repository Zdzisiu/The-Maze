A text adventure Maze narrated for you by Gamma

Content Warning: Death maze stuff, blood, description of gore and death


A demo of the decision tree "framework", a simple couple of functions that handle your decision trees with zero to minimal programming (unless you want to experiment!), you only need to fill out the arrays!

If you want to just write a text adventure and not bother with programming or shell work, ping me! or DM me! there should be no problem for me to add it to Gamma! Although you would need to use assets already avalible in this ghost.
